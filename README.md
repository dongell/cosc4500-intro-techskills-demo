### Requirements
1. Using Javascript/D3, create 2 arrays of random, count data within the domain (1-10). Sample size of each array should be 10.
2. Calculate mean, median, mode, standard deviation of each array and print them on the html with formatting.
3. Use these 2 arrays to define a x-axis and y-axis.
4. Build a svg-based scatterplot based on the random, count data generated in [1].
5. If I hover over any data point in said scatterplot, I should be able to see both data points i.e. 2,3 or 5,7 etc.
6. Your axes should be named appropriately. Since it's random data, come up with the most innovative names that you can think of.
7. Send a pull request of this html to https://github.com/shionguha/cosc4500-advdatascience-sp19/intro-techskills-demo/
8. Html should be named as "LastName-FirstName-MUID.html".
9. Make sure your d3 source file is referenced relatively. You do not have to send the d3 source file. I will put copies on the "intro-techskills-demo" folder so I can test your source code.
10. Within your html, provide a link to your own (free) github hosted html of this application. If I click on this link, it should take me to the github "host" where I can see your application running. It shouldn't send me to your github source code.

### Questions / Comments
1. How much formatting is necessary?
2. Should we use native JavaScript array functions as much as possible?
3. Make sure to correctly sort values in the arrays.
4. How to render HTML on GitHub?
